* Variables - Variables are boxes that hold values that can be used throughout a program. 

* Strings - Strings hold text values that are between quotations. 

* Functions (arguments, `return`) A function is a block of code that runs and returns the value after it runs. When  you   use a function somewhere in the code, you send arguements which are the values that you give the function to    be used, and then it returns the output from those inputs.
 
*`if` statements - If is a test statement that determines whether an expression is true , and if it is then it 	  executes the following block of code. 

* Boolean values (`true`, `false`) Boolean is whether something is true or false, also an equivalent to 1 or a 0 in     computer code. You can check if values are equal to other values.
